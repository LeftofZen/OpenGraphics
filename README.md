# OpenLoco/OpenGraphics

**OpenGraphics** is a project established to replace the base graphics of Locomotion. The aim is to create a set of freely-useable graphics that can be used with [OpenLoco](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco). This will help OpenLoco to be more accessible, as well as make it easier to add new features and content to the game.

This repo is based on https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics

## Progress

The current progress list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zyBDPd3A3Y6V_JwLgJM-HWvLoT4YG7c1Mf0cWVYPZGs/edit?gid=1386834576#gid=1386834576)

Our current focus is on the following object categories:
- Vehicles

Current blockers
- Blender plugin/workflow

## Getting Started

For most object types the most accurate and quickest way to create sprites is using the [RCT Graphics Helper add-on for Blender 2.79](https://github.com/oli414/Blender-RCT-Graphics)

Blender Render last available in [Blender 2.79](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/) is the most accurate render engine (for its time) that we have access to as an open source project.
You can use other software to create your models as well, as long as your main source file that you contribute to the project is a a Blender (.blend) file.

Scenery objects and stalls are currently the most accessible object type to create 3D models for. Check out [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zyBDPd3A3Y6V_JwLgJM-HWvLoT4YG7c1Mf0cWVYPZGs/edit?gid=1386834576#gid=1386834576) to see what has already been made. Just mark an object as WIP, and add your name to the author field.

## Requirements

- Only use [public domain textures](https://www.cgbookcase.com/textures).
- Save textures as PNG, and limit its size (1k should be plenty in most cases).
- Refrain from using premade models.
- AI-generated content of any kind is not allowed (textures, models, names, etc).
- Do not copy real life products (including companies, vehicles, buildings, etc). Look at how other games parody real life for inspiration; Planet Coaster is a good example of what is accepted.
- Objects need to maintain the same size and features as the original Locomotion objects.

## Community

You can get in touch with us via the OpenLoco Discord server. There is a dedicated OpenGraphics channel that can be used to discuss this sub-project.
